# House-Price-Prediction
"Estimates real estate values using machine learning."
This repository hosts a machine learning project dedicated to predicting house prices. The goal is to build robust models that can accurately estimate real estate values based on various features.

Project Overview
This project focuses on developing and evaluating machine learning models for house price prediction. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

Key Features
Machine Learning Models: Implements and compares various models, with a particular focus on XGBoost for its predictive power.

Evaluation Metrics: Model performance is rigorously assessed using key metrics such as:

R-squared (R 
2
 ): To measure how well future samples are likely to be predicted by the model.

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): To quantify the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction.

Technologies Used
1)Python
2)Scikit-learn
3)XGBoost
4)Pandas
5)NumPy
6)Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization, if applicable)
